      "Web application project using Next.js to create vegan recipes. It was made using React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS, forming a streamlined and visually appealing interface. Deployed through Vercel SDK, it leverages modern hosting and continuous integration tools to ensure robust performance. The application integrates with a MongoDB database, allowing for flexible data management and real-time updates to the recipe collection. This project served as a proof of concept demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of using these technologies together."
